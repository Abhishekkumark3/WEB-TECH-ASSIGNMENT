    <h3>1) Bulldog</h3>
    <p>According to data from Google Trends, the Bulldog is the most popular dog breed in the world. Estimates indicate that the search term ‘bulldog’ is searched on a worldwide basis over 1.5 million times every month. 

        Also known as the British Bulldog and English Bulldog, this breed has a very distinctive set of unmistakable facial features. The Bulldog is muscular and well-set. They are typically friendly and courageous, sporting a smooth and glossy coat. They need some exercise to avoid becoming overweight – although they prefer to spend hot, sunny days indoors, as their short snout can cause breathing difficulties.
        
        The history of the Bulldog dates back to the thirteenth century, when these brave dogs were used in the unsavory pastime of bull-baiting. Their sheer bravery and unbreakable spirit shines through to this day. England banned these brutal blood sports in 1835, and admirers faced a battle to prevent the breed from becoming extinct. The bulldog thus underwent a transformation from a fighter to a loyal, loving family pet who interacts well with children. 
        
        The phrase ‘bulldog spirit’ is derived from the tenacious nature of the breed. The dog is a national icon in England, and during the Second World War, Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s defiant attitude – not to mention his appearance – was likened to that of the Bulldog.</p>

        <h3>2) German Shepherd</h3>
        <p>Sometimes abbreviated to GSD, the German Shepherd is a medium-to-large sized working dog with a striking, wolf-like appearance. This working breed consistently places in second on the AKC list – with our research showing it is the same story on a worldwide scale.

            These large and agile dogs have extremely high intelligence and are loyal, brave and confident. GSDs are renowned for their character, with their loyalty and courage almost unmatched amongst canines. They can be trained for almost any task – German Shepherds are great family pets, reliable guard dogs, trained for police and military work, amongst a plethora of other jobs. 
            
            The breed was developed by German breeders who aspired to create the perfect herding dog. Although the German Shepherd dropped in popularity after the First and Second World Wars due to anti-German sentiment, it regularly features on lists of the most popular dog breeds around the world.</p>

        <h3>3) Labrador Retriever</h3>
        <p>The Labrador Retriever has been ranked as the most popular breed in the United States by the AKC since 1991; however, it only ranks in third spot across the world.

            Appearing in three colors (black, yellow or chocolate), the friendly and outgoing personality of a Lab makes them perfectly suited to life as a family pet. They are even-tempered and won’t hesitate to show love and affection. In addition, Labs are trained as service dogs in many countries; they can aid the blind, provide assistance to humans with autism or act as a therapy dog. Despite their relaxed disposition, these dogs love to engage in long games of fetch and can become destructive if left alone for too long.
            
            Labradors were imported to Europe from Canada in the 1830s to be used as gundogs. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, the British standardized the breed. To this day, the Lab is one of the most recognizable and loved breeds in almost all parts of the world.</p>
